# RoamSafe
========
Get where you wanna be, safely
--------

RoamSafe leverages the power of crowd-sourcing, crowd-helping, google maps, sms gateways and android to give you a simple experience to help you remain safe and vigil while you are moving around in your city.

The following are the main features:

1. Levelrage other peoples experience
---------------------
When you move around in your city, you will find unsafe areas marked in your vicinity. Safety starts with prevention, we suggest that you prevent such areas. The higher the concentration of 
unsafety-markers, the farther you should stay away from that place.
These markers are automatically updated, whenever someone hits the PANIC button on their app. 
Lets show you the power of the PANIC button.

2. Crowd-Helping
-----------------
There are good people out there. People who want to help. With this in mind, we came up with the concept of context-aware help. The second you hit the PANIC button, the server checks everyone who are is in our system currently, identifies the people who are in a 4 km radious of your current location, and sends them a notification stating that one of their vigilante friends is in distress. We understand that this might be a privacy concern, and this is easily configurable from within the app. The default selection is opt-out, so you would have to actually go and opt-in to this feature.
You can also opt-out of getting updates from other people who are in distress in your vicinity.


3. PANIC and contingencies:
------------------
Data connections by nature are unreliable, and smartphones, though highly affordable nowadays, are still catching up in India. 
Hence we have designed the app in a way to execute multiple contingencies one after the other.
Step1: Send all your emergency contacts your distress signal, and a link where they can see your location in realtime for the next half an hour. (from the time you press the PANIC button)
Step2: If you have opted-in to allow the app to send unknown people your distress signal, it will send the distress signal accordingly.
Step3: If for any reason you do not have a good data connection, then the app automatically calls the first person in the your emergency contacts. 
Step4: It also sends a message to our SMS gateway, and Step1 and Step2 are executed by the server on your behalf.
Step5: The server stores this location, so that other users see that this was marked as an unsafe location.

4. People without smartphones and data-connections.
----------
You can easily register with our server, using your current phone number even without a smartphone. If in distress, send in a message (to our toll-free SMS gateway) with the text as the street address or interesction (without any special characters) and the server will take care of doing everything for you.

Hope this quick, short introduction helped you understand the impact this app will bring in improving the overall safety in your life.
